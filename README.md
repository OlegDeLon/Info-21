In this project I made RestApi application that show you some information about 21School students, their projects and other activity.

You need to run app and open http://localhost:8080, then you need to pass the registration by Email, and log in.

I used PostgreSQL as DataBase, SpringMVC, JDBC, SpringDataJPA, SpringSecurity, MailSender, Hibernate, HTML, Thymeleaf, CSS, BootStrap.
